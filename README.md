<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer and am currently enrolled in the Web Development Pathway with Code Louisville. Having just started in this pathway, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how each is used to develop an intuitive, engaging, and purposeful website.</p>
<p>Interesting facts about me:</p>
- I've been in the Education field for 11 years<br>
- I am currently an Assistant Principal at an elementary school serving approximately 600 students<br>
- I ***live*** to travel<br>
- If I don't know the answer to something, I feverishly research until I find the answer<br>
